I will use MainWindow.xaml instead

1 - Create view's skeleton:
    a - The View contains the design datacontext pointing 
        to a DesignInstance of the ViewModel.

3 - Code the view with fixed content:
    a - In this step we only need to modify the View.xaml 
        file and it is as simple or as complex as the view
        requirements are.
    b - No bindings at all, only fixed content.
