# Edit Profiles #

The most of my work projects use [Omicron Test Universe](https://www.omicronenergy.com/en/products/test-universe/) as main test tool.  
However modifying, or correcting the test files manually is cumbersome.  
Edit Profiles can automate this process (for now only for ExeCute modules).  
> Current version is v1.2

### Usage: ###

* Enter "Find what:" field your search criteria seperated by "|" character.
* Enter "Replace with:" field your replacement items in this field seperated by "|" character.
* If your Omicron Control Center (*.occ) file(s) is/are password protected enter the password to "Password to edit file(s)" field.
* Use "removeModule=moduleName" to delete named ExeCute test module from your test file.
